## Predict the relevance of search results on homedepot.com

In this competition, Home Depot is asking Kagglers to help them improve their customers' shopping experience by developing a model that can accurately predict the relevance of search results.
search relevancy is an implicit measure Home Depot uses to gauge how quickly they can get customers to the right products. Currently, human raters evaluate the impact of potential changes to their search algorithms, which is a slow and subjective process.
By removing or minimizing human input in search relevance evaluation, Home Depot hopes to increase the number of iterations their team can perform on the current search algorithms.
